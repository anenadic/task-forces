## Task Force Charter: Workshop Capacity

Approval date: Monday, 17 October, 2022  
Completion date: Friday, 28 October, 2022

### Context
We have been experiencing very limited availability of Instructors to teach Centrally-Organised Workshops (COW), and are currently unable
to meet demand from Members and a-la-carte workshop requests. We have had to cancel or postpone several workshops. Some strategies are
currently being explored to try to increase Instructor capacity, including providing compensation for Instructors and returning to in-person
workshops, however, it remains to be seen whether these changes will result in increased capacity and it may be some time before we know if
they are having the desired effects. 

### Objective
The objective of this task force is to identify a solution to the problem of low Instructor availability and provide a recommendation to the Executive Team. The recommended solution will be implemented quickly (immediately to within 2 months) and should be sustainable for up to one year. Two potential solutions to explore are provided below, however, the task force should brainstorm and weigh the pros and cons of all potential solutions:

- Utilizing Core Team members to teach workshops, and
- Reducing our workshop offerings to match Instructor availability and communicating explicitly with Members about reduced capacity.


### Deliverables
1. A pros and cons matrix comparing potential solutions.
2. An explicit recommendation as to which solution to pursue. 

The remaining deliverables are dependent upon which solution is recommended:
1. Core Team members teaching workshops 
  * A list of which CT members can teach which lessons
  * An estimate of how much capacity it will add to our workshops for all certified CT Instructors to teach for 5% of their time
  * Some ideas about what other work can be put down to give CT members this capacity

2. Reducing our workshops 
  * Talking points for how we will communicate this with Members and others requesting workshops
  * An estimate of how many Silver Memberships we can support with our current capacity
