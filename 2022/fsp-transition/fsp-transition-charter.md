## Task Force Charter: Fiscal Sponsorship Transition Taskforce

Approval date: 19 July 2022 <br/>
Completion date: 

### Context
The Carpentries is a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. A fiscal sponsor is a unique type of nonprofit organization that shares its 501(c)(3)* status with unincorporated nonprofit projects. This allows projects to receive grants and tax-exempt donations from government, foundations, and individuals. Community Initiatives also provides back office services including non-profit compliance, financial management, risk management and insurance, grant and donation management, and payroll and benefits services.

The Carpentries has matured in its operations and finances and has determined, with the support of the Executive Council, that it is time to develop a plan to transition out of fiscal sponsorship. 

As requested by the Executive Council Finance Committee, a [3-year transition preparation plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1llOjX1exN9Mex3bwoQXuWIMRDsBTfOCdWtZ_e_ZYOZY/edit#) was developed to include activities before, during, and after the transition. A [detailed roadmap](https://app.asana.com/0/1201615963882247/1201615963882247) is being developed in Asana to include responsible parties and deadlines. 

*The term 501(c)3 is in reference to section 501(c)(3) of the US Internal Revenue Code that allows for federal tax exemption of nonprofit organizations.
