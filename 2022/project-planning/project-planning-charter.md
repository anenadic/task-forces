# Context
Our project planning workflow was developed in 2018 and revised in 2020. In its current form it does not take into account the complexities of community involvement, competing priorities, and the need for flexible timelines. In Q2 2022, the Executive Team completed a listening tour, in part to gather information about how the project planning process is and isn’t working for our teams. 

# Objectives
As a result of feedback received during the listening tour, the Executive Team is bringing together a working group to adapt our current project planning workflow to include:
- Flexible scheduling - projects will still have defined start and end dates, but do not need to take place on a quarterly schedule,
- A process for sharing / piloting ideas before they become official projects,
- Clarity on decision making authority for project personnel - e.g. when Core Team members sit on multiple projects/teams, who clarifies priorities and how time should be allocated?
- Identified stages in project planning - e.g. planning phase, piloting phase.

# Deliverables
- A glossary of terms related to project planning, including: project, workflow, milestone, working group, and task force,
- A plan for pitching projects / sharing project ideas before official project adoption,
- An updated project planning workflow document,
- An updated Asana project template,
- A clear definition of decision making authority for all aspects of project planning, including project member recruitment and official project approval.
- An implementation and communication plan that includes how the team will be supported through this change

The working group should present final versions of these deliverables to the Executive Team by the group’s completion date listed above. The Working Group Lead should provide weekly written updates to their Supervisor on the group’s progress.
