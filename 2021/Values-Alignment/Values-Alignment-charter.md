## Task Force Charter: Values Alignment TaskForce

Approval date:  2021-06-15

Completion date: 

### Context
Over the last year, our use of certain platforms has been a topic of discussion following the release of information that suggests an organisation may not be acting in accordance with or in alignment with our Values. Some examples include, discussion around the use of Hootsuite or Git/GitHub was discussed after contracts with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were announced. These events sparked [conversations around the question 'Who should the Carpentries align ourselves with?'][109].

### Objective
The objective of this Task Force is to deliver a set of recommendations - a [‘Due Diligence’ process][duediligence] - for approval by the Executive Council on how to identify whether an organisation or service is acting in accordance with The Carpentries [Core Values][values]. These recommendations are to be used as checkpoints to check that the existing relationships and service providers are conforming and to verify that The Carpentries can safely enter into new relationships with organisations in the future. This may include establishing a separate long-term Committee (for example, “Values Committee”) to apply these recommendations.


### Deliverables
1. Recommendations for review by the EC,  including a rubric to be added to The Carpentries Handbook if the Task force recommends to make it openly available
2. Blog post summary of Task Force discussions with the release of a recommendation
