## Retrospective: Instructor Feedback Task Force

### Background
#### Context

Occasionally, there are workshop hosts that provide constructive feedback regarding an instructor that has been placed at their workshop. The feedback provided generally reflects the instructors teaching style or not meeting expectations. This proposal will discuss recommendations for what to do with the constructive feedback we receive for a particular Carpentries instructor.

In order to address all of the concerns, it is recommended to create a Task Force to identify   next steps after receiving the feedback   for the instructor. Representatives from the  following teams would participate: 
Community Development Team
- Rationale: Some discussion has surrounded having the Instructor Development Team assist with further developing the Instructors when they receive constructive feedback
Instructor Training Team
- Rationale: The feedback provided may impact what is being taught in the Instructor Training curriculum. Alternatively, may require additional bonus modules 
Workshop Administration Team
- Rationale: The feedback always come to the WAT and understanding the next steps and proper communication channels is needed 

### Objective

The goal of this Task Force was to identify what the next steps for the Instructor will be after receiving constructive feedback. There may be work that the above teams may have to develop/improve. From the recommendation, each of the task force members reported back to their teams to implement the proper workflow to ensure the next steps are in place. 

### Deliverables

- [Post-Workshop Survey](https://admin.typeform.com/form/W3EQFVUO/create?block=bd019ae4-3226-4317-bc5c-399a9fc1282c) 
- Updated automated emails sent to Workshop Host and Instructors to include survey information 
- Schedule One-on-one meetings with workshop hosts/instructors when feedback scores are low
*The task force will not update the corresponding workflows, but will make those recommendations, and Team Leads will work to implement the recommendations.


### Task Force Members

- Kelly Barnes, Instructor Training Team
- Sher! Hurt, Workshop Adminstration Team
- Angelique Trusler, Community Developement Team

#### What went well?
- Discussions were very robust and fruitful. Many ideas generated. 
- The TF did not rush to create a plan
- The workload was not overbearing. The TF used meeting times to co-work. 
- Each team had representation and provided feedback as needed. 
- All of the TF members had a good understanding of the Workshop Admin Team workflow.


#### What did not go well?
- There were vacations and holidays which caused the TF to go longer than anticipated.
- There were sever high priority recommendations provided but were low on the implementation list due to developer time. 
- Narrowing down what the TF should recommend. There were several discussion and great ideas presented. 

## Recommendations for future Task Forces
- Incorporate co-working time to not add more work outside of meeting times
- If time allows extend the co-working sessions to 1.5 - 2 hours.
