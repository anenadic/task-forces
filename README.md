# The Carpentries Task Forces

The Carpentries uses Task Forces to explore ideas and make updates in policy, procedures and guidelines. Task forces bring together a small group of people focused on a particular topic for a set period of time. Task forces are proposed by the community, Lesson Programs, Carpentries [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) and Executive Council, and are approved by the Executive Council. 

Each Task Force includes:

- A Task Force Charter that outlines the context, objectives and deliverables of the Task Force
- A set timeline for the start and completion of the task force work
- An associated public facing GitHub project for information about the Task Force during its work

A Task Force report is shared with the Executive Council upon completion of the work, and deliverables are developed and shared as outlined in the Task Force Charter.

[Task Force Charter template](task-force-charter-template.md)

The current mechanism for creation of a Task Force is for the Executive Council or [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) to identify needs for information gathering or updates in current policies, guidelines or products, and collaboratively draft a Charter with relevant members of the community. Members of the community interested in proposing or leading a Task Force should get in touch with the Executive Council at [carpentries-executive-council@carpentries.org](mailto:carpentries-executive-council@carpentries.org).

This is a repository for our Task Force Charters and associated GitHub project boards.
